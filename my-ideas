1-I think it's better to add more widgets and layouts to it
2-Kivy have a problem in right click that put red dots I wish in next version this ability be off as default
3-its designer project is unpleasent to use for RAD designers I wish for beta or stable versions
4-incorrect position of touch in my linux device (you should touch upper than your widget to touch that widget

I'm a new kivy user it's so fun and easy to use I wish for more abilities for make pro applications for end users not just prototyping because it's fantastic for cross platform
development
